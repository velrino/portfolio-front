      "p2": "I master multiple technologies — JavaScript/TypeScript, React, Node.js, Python, Golang, Flutter — but not as a hobby. Each tool in my arsenal was chosen because it solves a specific type of problem better than others. I don't get attached to technologies; I get attached to results.",
      "p3": "I lead teams, manage agile procedures, and make strategic technical decisions as a CTO. But my greatest value is in connecting the dots: between what the business needs, what technology can do, and what the team can deliver."
